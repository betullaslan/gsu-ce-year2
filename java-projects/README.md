## File: `BouncingBallInZone.java`

**Description:**  
A motion simulation where a ball moves with a randomized direction, bounces off the canvas edges, and interacts with a fixed rectangular zone. If the ball enters the rectangle, its speed is halved. If it strikes the rectangle at a shallow angle (< 45°), it bounces based on the angle of impact.

## File: `CalculatorApp.java`

**Description:**  
A functional calculator built using Java AWT. It supports integer and decimal inputs, and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Inputs are controlled via button clicks, and internal arrays store digits and decimal parts for precise calculations.

## File: `CannonShooterGame.java`

**Description:**  
A simple shooting game where the player rotates a cannon on top of a randomly placed ground box and fires bullets to hit a flying airplane. The airplane moves from left to right and resets upon reaching the edge. Only one bullet can be on screen at a time. Pressing space ends the game.

## File: `ColorMatchCatcher.java`

**Description:**  
A reflex-based color-matching game where the player controls a basket to catch falling balls. The goal is to catch only the balls that match the basket’s color. The player gains points for correct catches and loses points for incorrect ones. The game ends when the player reaches 5 points.

## File: `PaddleBallDuel.java`

**Description:**  
A two-player paddle game where each player tries to prevent the ball from crossing their respective goal line. The ball bounces off paddles and walls, and the first player to score 3 points wins. Controlled via keyboard (Player 1: A/Z, Player 2: UP/DOWN).

## File: `WatchClassHierarchy.java`

**Description:**  
A class-based model of watches, demonstrating object-oriented programming. The hierarchy includes a base `Saat` class and derived classes for analog and digital wristwatches. Digital watches support alarm setting, stopwatch simulation, and date handling using `Calendar`.
